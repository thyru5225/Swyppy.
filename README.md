The Swipe App is a modern web application designed for a smooth and intuitive media experience. Instead of scrolling endlessly, users can swipe in different directions to view content:

Swipe left or right → browse through photos seamlessly.

Swipe up or down → explore engaging videos.

This interaction creates a fast, natural way of discovering media, making the app feel more dynamic and interactive compared to traditional feeds.

The website version of the Swipe App is built using:

HTML5 – for clean and semantic page structure.

CSS3 – for styling and responsive design.

Bootstrap – for a mobile-first grid system, layouts, and prebuilt UI components.

Java – for handling backend logic, user accounts, and media management.

The result is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web app where users can upload, share, and swipe through content without distractions.
